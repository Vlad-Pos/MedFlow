# 🔒 Security & GDPR Audit Task

**Comprehensive security and compliance verification for MedFlow medical data**

This task serves dual purposes:
1. **AI Agent Assessment** - Testing comprehension and security expertise
2. **System Maintenance** - Ensuring medical-grade security and GDPR compliance

---

## 🎯 **Your Mission**

Conduct a comprehensive security and GDPR compliance audit of the MedFlow application to ensure all medical data is properly protected, authentication systems are secure, and the application meets Romanian and EU data protection requirements for healthcare applications.

---

## 🚨 **Critical Security Requirements**

### **MedFlow Security Standards - MUST MAINTAIN**
```javascript
Authentication Security: Multi-factor authentication support
Data Encryption: End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
GDPR Compliance: Full compliance with EU data protection regulations
Access Control: Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
Audit Logging: Comprehensive audit trails for all data access
Data Minimization: Only necessary data collected and stored
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Medical applications handle sensitive patient data and must meet the highest security standards. Any security vulnerability could compromise patient privacy and trust.
