## üìã **Task Requirements**

### **What You Must Do**
1. **Read MAIN_GUIDE.md completely** before starting any work
2. **Examine all UI components** for brand color usage
3. **Identify any violations** of the 12 new brand colors
4. **Provide specific file locations** and line numbers for issues
5. **Recommend exact fixes** with correct color codes
6. **Generate overall brand health score** (1-10 scale)

### **Scope of Analysis**
- **All React components** in the `src/components/` directory
- **Styling files** (CSS, Tailwind classes, styled components)
- **Configuration files** that define colors (Tailwind config, theme files)
- **Documentation files** that reference brand colors
- **Any other files** that contain color definitions or references

---

## üîç **Analysis Methodology**

### **Step 1: Systematic File Examination**
1. **Start with core components** in `src/components/`
2. **Check styling files** for color definitions
3. **Examine configuration files** for theme settings
4. **Review documentation** for color references
5. **Scan for any hardcoded colors** that might violate brand guidelines

### **Step 2: Color Violation Detection**
1. **Identify any colors** that don't match the 7 sacred colors
2. **Check for color variations** that might be close but incorrect
3. **Look for deprecated colors** or outdated color schemes
4. **Verify color usage** in different contexts (buttons, backgrounds, text)

### **Step 3: Severity Assessment**
- **Critical**: Wrong colors in primary UI elements
- **High**: Incorrect colors in secondary components
- **Medium**: Minor color variations or inconsistencies
- **Low**: Documentation or comment color references
