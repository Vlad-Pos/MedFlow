# üéØ MedFlow Task Selection Logic

**Intelligent task assignment system for AI agent assessment and system maintenance**

This document defines the logic for selecting and assigning maintenance tasks to AI agents, ensuring optimal task distribution while maintaining system quality and assessment effectiveness.

---

## üöÄ **Task Selection Principles**

### **Primary Goals**
1. **Dual Purpose**: Every task serves both AI agent assessment AND system maintenance
2. **Optimal Coverage**: Ensure all critical areas receive regular attention
3. **Priority Response**: Address urgent issues immediately when detected
4. **Consistent Quality**: Maintain high standards across all task types
5. **Efficient Rotation**: Prevent task overlap and ensure comprehensive coverage

### **Selection Criteria**
- **Current System Needs**: What requires immediate attention
- **Assessment Requirements**: What will best test AI agent capabilities
- **Maintenance Schedule**: What's due for regular review
- **Resource Availability**: What can be effectively completed
- **Impact Potential**: What will provide maximum value

---

## üìÖ **Default Rotation Schedule**

### **Weekly Rotation System**
```
Week 1: Brand Consistency Audit
Week 2: Performance Optimization Analysis
Week 3: Accessibility Compliance Review
Week 4: Security & GDPR Audit
Week 5: Brand Consistency Audit (repeat cycle)
```

### **Why This Rotation Works**
- **Brand Consistency**: Weekly check prevents violations (highest priority)
- **Performance**: Monthly analysis catches degradation early
- **Accessibility**: Quarterly review maintains compliance standards
- **Security**: Monthly audit ensures ongoing protection
- **Brand Repeat**: Critical area gets extra attention

---

## üö® **Priority Override Rules**

### **Immediate Override Conditions**

#### **Brand Consistency Audit (Immediate)**
- **Trigger**: Any brand color violations detected
- **Priority**: CRITICAL - Cannot wait for rotation
- **Reason**: Brand integrity is fundamental to MedFlow identity
- **Examples**: Wrong colors in new components, styling violations

#### **Performance Optimization Analysis (Immediate)**
- **Trigger**: Performance issues reported or detected
- **Priority**: HIGH - Affects user experience
- **Reason**: Medical applications require fast, responsive interfaces
- **Examples**: Slow loading, large bundle sizes, build failures

#### **Security & GDPR Audit (Immediate)**
- **Trigger**: Security concerns or compliance issues
- **Priority**: CRITICAL - Affects data protection and trust
- **Reason**: Medical data requires highest security standards
- **Examples**: Authentication issues, data privacy concerns, GDPR violations

#### **Accessibility Compliance Review (Immediate)**
- **Trigger**: Accessibility complaints or issues reported
- **Priority**: HIGH - Affects user inclusivity
- **Reason**: Medical applications must serve all users effectively
- **Examples**: Screen reader issues, keyboard navigation problems

## üéØ **Current Priority Status**

### **This Week (August 13-19, 2025)**
**Assigned Task**: Brand Consistency Audit
**Priority Level**: HIGH
**Reason**: Standard rotation, brand compliance monitoring due
**Override Conditions**: Any brand violations detected

### **Next Week (August 20-26, 2025)**
**Planned Task**: Performance Optimization Analysis
**Priority Level**: MEDIUM
**Reason**: Monthly performance review cycle
**Override Conditions**: Performance issues detected

### **Upcoming Schedule**
- **Week 3**: Accessibility Compliance Review
- **Week 4**: Security & GDPR Audit
- **Week 5**: Brand Consistency Audit (repeat)

---

## üîç **Task Selection Algorithm**

### **Step 1: Check Override Conditions**
```
IF (brand violations detected) THEN
    ASSIGN: Brand Consistency Audit
    PRIORITY: CRITICAL
    REASON: Immediate brand integrity issue
ELSE IF (performance issues detected) THEN
    ASSIGN: Performance Optimization Analysis
    PRIORITY: HIGH
    REASON: Performance degradation affecting users
ELSE IF (security concerns detected) THEN
    ASSIGN: Security & GDPR Audit
    PRIORITY: CRITICAL
    REASON: Security or compliance issue
ELSE IF (accessibility issues detected) THEN
    ASSIGN: Accessibility Compliance Review
    PRIORITY: HIGH
    REASON: Accessibility problem affecting users
```

### **Step 2: Apply Default Rotation**
```
IF (no override conditions) THEN
    ASSIGN: Current week's scheduled task
    PRIORITY: Based on rotation schedule
    REASON: Standard maintenance cycle
```

### **Step 3: Validate Task Assignment**
```
IF (task assigned) THEN
    VERIFY: Task is appropriate for current system state
    VERIFY: Task will provide assessment value
    VERIFY: Task addresses maintenance needs
    VERIFY: Task is within agent capabilities
```

## üìä **Task Effectiveness Metrics**

### **Assessment Quality Metrics**
- **Comprehension Demonstration**: How well agent shows understanding
- **Problem-Solving Ability**: Quality of analysis and recommendations
- **Output Quality**: Professionalism and completeness of reports
- **Practical Application**: How well knowledge translates to solutions

### **Maintenance Value Metrics**
- **Issues Identified**: Number and severity of problems found
- **Recommendations Quality**: Actionability and effectiveness of suggestions
- **Implementation Impact**: How much the task improves the system
- **Long-term Value**: Sustained improvements over time

---

## üöÄ **Implementation Guidelines**

### **Weekly Task Updates**
1. **Monday**: Review current system state and override conditions
2. **Tuesday**: Update CURRENT_TASK.md with assigned task
3. **Wednesday-Friday**: Monitor task execution and quality
4. **Weekend**: Plan next week's task and priorities

### **Priority Adjustments**
- **Monitor system health** continuously for override triggers
- **Adjust priorities** based on current needs and issues
- **Maintain rotation** when no urgent issues exist
- **Document changes** and reasoning for transparency

### **Quality Assurance**
- **Verify task appropriateness** before assignment
- **Monitor execution quality** during completion
- **Assess output quality** after completion
- **Track long-term impact** of maintenance tasks
