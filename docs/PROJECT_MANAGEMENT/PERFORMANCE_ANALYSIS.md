# ⚡ Performance Optimization Analysis Task

**Comprehensive performance standards compliance and optimization analysis for MedFlow**

This task serves dual purposes:
1. **AI Agent Assessment** - Testing comprehension and technical problem-solving abilities
2. **System Maintenance** - Ensuring performance standards are met and identifying optimization opportunities

---

## 🎯 **Your Mission**

Conduct a comprehensive performance optimization analysis of the MedFlow application to ensure all performance standards are met and identify opportunities for improvement in bundle size, load time, code splitting, and build performance.

---

## 🚨 **Critical Performance Requirements**

### **MedFlow Performance Standards - MUST MAINTAIN**
```javascript
Bundle Size: < 2.5 MB (gzipped)
Load Time: < 2 seconds (first meaningful paint)
Code Splitting: > 30 chunks (for optimal loading)
Build Time: < 10 seconds (development builds)
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: These standards are essential for medical applications where speed and responsiveness directly impact user experience and patient care.
