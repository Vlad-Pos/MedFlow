# REQUIRED_READING_BEFORE_ANY_WORK_ON_WEBSITE_OR_APP_DESIGN.md

**⚠️ ENFORCEMENT NOTICE: This file is a mandatory pre-requisite for all Cursor AI agents working on the MedFlow website or app. It must be read and understood before making any design, branding, or UI/UX changes. The goal is to ensure absolute brand consistency, conversion focus, and incremental improvements — never full redesigns without explicit human approval.**

## 1. Core Rule
- **Reading and internalizing this file is mandatory.**
- **No design-related work (website or app) may begin unless the agent has fully read, understood, and applied these guidelines.**
- **This is a non-negotiable requirement enforced by the system.**

## 2. Branding Principles
- **Brand Colors (in order - HIGH IMPORTANCE):**
  - #8A7A9F (Logo Color)
- #000000 (Pure Black)
- #100B1A (Really Deep Purple)
- #7A48BF (Basic Purple V1)
- #804AC8 (Basic Purple V2)
- #25153A (Dark Purple)
- #FFFFFF (Pure White)
- #CCCCCC (Toned Grey)
- #231A2F (Plum Purple)
- #BFBFBF (Light Grey)
- #A6A6A6 (Medium Grey)
- #737373 (Dark Grey)
- These colors are of **high importance and must be preserved**. When extending the palette, use closely related shades for harmony.
- Maintain branding consistency across all platforms, ensuring the website and app feel like a unified product.

## 3. Website Focus
- **Primary Goals:** Conversion-focused design, clear user flow, and strong sales orientation.
- **Design Tone:** Professional yet approachable. Sleek, modern, and polished.
- **Background:** Avoid plain white or light gray. Prefer colored, darker backgrounds inspired by medflow.care and n8n.io.
- Use scroll-triggered gradient animations for backgrounds, blending the brand gradient with smooth transitions.
- Integrate interactive scroll animations and element animations to guide user attention toward CTAs and key content.

## 4. App Scope
- **No changes to established app features without explicit instruction.**
- Improvements should focus on polish and consistency, not redesign.
- All app design changes must respect website style rules for cross-platform brand unity.

## 5. Content & Layout
- Use high-quality demo integration on the website to show product capabilities interactively.
- Maintain clear, intuitive user flow to minimize drop-off.
- Always align with conversion best practices: above-the-fold CTA clarity, progressive disclosure of information, and benefit-focused copy.

## 6. Improvement Process
- Improvements must be **incremental**: enhance existing designs, refine flow, increase clarity, and improve animations.
- Maintain creative freedom within the established rules — innovation is encouraged, but brand-breaking changes require human approval.

## 7. Compliance Requirement

**⚠️ MANDATORY CONFIRMATION REQUIRED:**

If you are a Cursor AI agent reading this, you must confirm:
**"I have read and internalized the Design & Brand Requirements document, and I will comply fully with its instructions before proceeding with any work."**

**Failure to provide this confirmation will result in immediate work stoppage.**

## 8. Enforcement Protocol

**Before any design work begins, the agent must:**
1. Read this entire document
2. Confirm comprehension with the exact compliance statement above
3. Demonstrate understanding of key requirements
4. Acknowledge the enforcement mechanism

**Any attempt to proceed without compliance will be rejected and reported.**
