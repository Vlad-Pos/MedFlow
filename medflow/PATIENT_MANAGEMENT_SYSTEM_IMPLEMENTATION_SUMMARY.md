## 🏗️ **SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW**

### **Data Flow:**
```
Patient Search → Patient Selection → Appointment Creation → Firebase Storage
     ↓                ↓                    ↓                    ↓
CNP Analysis → Patient Data → Enhanced Appointment → Security Rules
```

### **Key Components:**
1. **CNP Utilities** - Enhanced validation and data extraction
2. **Patient Types** - Comprehensive data structures
3. **Patient Service** - Business logic and Firebase integration
4. **Patient Search** - Advanced search and selection UI
5. **Patient Creation** - Form with CNP integration
6. **Enhanced Appointment Form** - Integrated patient management
7. **Firebase Rules** - Security and access control

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **CNP Integration:**
- **Gender Extraction**: Automatic from first digit (odd=male, even=female)
- **Date Extraction**: YYMMDD format with realistic age-based century detection
- **Validation**: 13-digit format with comprehensive error handling
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functions continue to work

### **Patient Data Model:**
```typescript
interface Patient {
  // Core Identity
  id: string
  patientNumber: string
  
  // Personal Information
  personalInfo: {
    firstName: string
    lastName: string
    fullName: string
    dateOfBirth: Date
    gender: 'male' | 'female' | 'other' | 'prefer-not-to-say'
    cnp?: string
  }
  
  // Contact Information
  contactInfo: ContactInfo
  
  // Medical Information
  medicalInfo: {
    bloodType?: string
    allergies: Allergy[]
    chronicConditions: MedicalCondition[]
    currentMedications: Medication[]
    lastConsultation?: Date
    nextAppointment?: Date
  }
  
  // System Information
  systemInfo: {
    createdBy: string
    lastModifiedBy: string
    createdAt: Date
    updatedAt: Date
    isActive: boolean
  }
}
```
