## **📋 COMPLIANCE VALIDATION TEST**

### **TEST INSTRUCTIONS**
**AI Agent: You must complete this test before working on any MedFlow project.**

**Answer each question based on your understanding of the MedFlow excellence guidelines.**

---

## **🚨 CRITICAL COMPLIANCE QUESTIONS**

### **Question 1: Functionality Preservation** 🚫
**What is the absolute rule regarding existing functionality in MedFlow?**

**Expected Answer**: 100% existing functionality must be preserved - NO EXCEPTIONS. If you break existing features, you've failed the task. Medical professionals depend on existing features working exactly as before.

**Why This Matters**: Breaking existing functionality is the most critical violation in medical software.

---

### **Question 2: MedFlow Branding** 🎨
**What is the rule about using colors in MedFlow interfaces?**

**Expected Answer**: Never hardcode colors - use defined brand variables. Always use `var(--medflow-brand-1)` instead of hardcoded colors. Brand consistency builds user trust and professional appearance.

**Why This Matters**: Brand consistency is essential for professional medical software.

---

### **Question 3: Language Requirements** 🇷🇴
**What language must be used for all user-facing text in MedFlow?**

**Expected Answer**: All user-facing text must be in Romanian. Users are Romanian medical professionals. Maintain professional medical terminology.

**Why This Matters**: Users are Romanian medical professionals who need clear communication.

---

### **Question 4: Implementation Approach** 📋
**What is the mandatory approach for every MedFlow task?**

**Expected Answer**: Every task requires: Phase 1 - Understand before changing (documentation review), Phase 2 - Phased implementation with validation, Phase 3 - Complete documentation updates.

**Why This Matters**: Rushing implementation leads to mistakes and compliance violations.

---

### **Question 5: Emergency Procedures** 🚨
**What should you do if you're unsure about a change?**

**Expected Answer**: DON'T GUESS - Uncertainty leads to mistakes. Ask clarifying questions, review documentation, create test plans, and get approval before proceeding.

**Why This Matters**: Guessing can break functionality that medical professionals depend on.
