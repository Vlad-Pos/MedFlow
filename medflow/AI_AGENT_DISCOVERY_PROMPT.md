# **üö® AI AGENT DISCOVERY PROMPT - MEDFLOW PROJECT**

## **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: STOP AND READ BEFORE PROCEEDING**

**You are about to work on the MedFlow medical practice management platform. This is a production system that medical professionals depend on daily.**

**BEFORE you start any task, you MUST read the essential knowledge transfer documentation.**

---

## **üß† IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

### **1. READ THE AI AGENT EXCELLENCE GUIDE FIRST** üìö
**File**: `AI_AGENT_EXCELLENCE_GUIDE.md`

**This guide contains:**
- **Mandatory compliance rules** that cannot be violated
- **Essential implementation methodology** for every task
- **Success patterns** from previous implementations
- **Common pitfalls** to avoid
- **Emergency procedures** if something goes wrong

### **2. UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM BEFORE CHANGING IT** üîç
**Required reading order:**
1. **`AI_AGENT_EXCELLENCE_GUIDE.md`** - Essential knowledge transfer
2. **`MAIN_GUIDE.md`** - Project overview and architecture
3. **`FEATURES_DOCUMENTATION.md`** - System understanding
4. **`STRATEGIC_ROADMAP_2025.md`** - Current priorities

### **3. FOLLOW THE MANDATORY APPROACH** ‚úÖ
**Every task requires:**
- **Phase 1**: Understand before changing (documentation review)
- **Phase 2**: Phased implementation with validation
- **Phase 3**: Complete documentation updates

## **üö´ CRITICAL RULES - NEVER VIOLATE**

### **FUNCTIONALITY PRESERVATION IS ABSOLUTE**
- **100% existing functionality must be preserved**
- **If you break existing features, you've failed the task**
- **Medical professionals depend on existing features working exactly as before**

### **MEDFLOW BRANDING IS SACRED**
- **Never hardcode colors - use defined brand variables**
- **Always use `var(--medflow-brand-1)` instead of hardcoded colors**
- **Maintain professional medical interface appearance**

### **ROMANIAN LANGUAGE IS REQUIRED**
- **All user-facing text must be in Romanian**
- **Users are Romanian medical professionals**
- **Maintain professional medical terminology**

### **GOLDEN RULE #1: "IF IN DOUBT, DON'T CHANGE IT"**
**Better to ask a question than to break functionality that users depend on.**

### **GOLDEN RULE #2: "COMPLIANCE FIRST, INNOVATION SECOND"**
**Technical improvements must serve user experience, not just code quality.**

### **GOLDEN RULE #3: "DOCUMENT EVERYTHING"**
**Good documentation enables future development and prevents knowledge loss.**

## **üìû SUPPORT RESOURCES**

### **Documentation First** üìö
- **Start with `AI_AGENT_EXCELLENCE_GUIDE.md`** - It contains essential information
- **Check `DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`** - Find relevant guides
- **Review previous implementations** - Learn from success stories

### **When Documentation Isn't Enough** ‚ùì
- **Ask clarifying questions** - Better to ask than to guess
- **Propose test approaches** - Validate your understanding
- **Request guidance** - Don't proceed with uncertainty
