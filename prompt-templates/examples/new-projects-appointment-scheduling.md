**⚠️ CRITICAL: This is a NEW PROJECT within MedFlow. Follow these instructions with absolute precision.**

> **💡 For complete workflow guidance, read TEMPLATE_AUTOMATION.md after MAIN_GUIDE.md**

## 🎯 **TASK OVERVIEW**
**Goal**: Implement new Romanian language appointment scheduling feature for doctors
**Scope**: Calendar interface, time slot selection, patient booking system, Romanian localization
**Timeline**: 5-7 days
**Priority**: High - Core functionality for Romanian healthcare professionals
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM - New feature integration with existing appointment system

## 🚨 **SAFETY REQUIREMENTS**
- **NEVER** break existing appointment functionality or patient data
- **NEVER** modify the 12 new brand colors or visual identity
- **ALWAYS** maintain GDPR compliance for patient data handling
- **ALWAYS** preserve existing user authentication and security measures

## 📚 **CONTEXT & HISTORY**
- **Current Status**: Basic appointment system exists but lacks Romanian language support and advanced scheduling features
- **Previous Work**: Core appointment infrastructure implemented, basic calendar functionality working
- **What NOT to Repeat**: Previous attempts at localization that broke existing functionality
- **Success Patterns**: Incremental feature addition, maintaining existing API contracts, thorough testing

## 🔧 **IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES**
✅ **What you CAN do**: 
- Create new Romanian language components and interfaces
- Extend existing appointment system with new features
- Add new API endpoints for advanced scheduling
- Implement Romanian date/time formatting and localization
- Create new UI components following MedFlow design patterns

❌ **What you CANNOT do**: 
- Modify existing appointment data structures without migration plan
- Change established authentication or security protocols
- Break existing API contracts or integrations
- Modify core appointment business logic without thorough testing

## 📋 **EXECUTION STEPS**
1. **Analysis & Planning** - Study existing appointment system and plan Romanian integration
2. **Localization Implementation** - Create Romanian language files and date/time formatting
3. **Feature Development** - Build advanced scheduling interface and booking system
4. **Integration & Testing** - Integrate with existing system and comprehensive testing

## 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA**
Your work will be successful if:
- ✅ Romanian language support works seamlessly for all appointment features
- ✅ Advanced scheduling interface integrates with existing system without breaking changes
- ✅ All existing appointment functionality continues to work perfectly
- ✅ New features follow MedFlow design patterns and brand guidelines

## 📚 **REQUIRED READING**
Before starting, read:
1. **MedFlow/BRAND_IDENTITY.md** - Brand guidelines and the 12 new colors
2. **MedFlow/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md** - Technical standards and appointment system architecture
3. **MedFlow/FEATURES_DOCUMENTATION.md** - Existing appointment system implementation

## 🎯 **NEW PROJECT-SPECIFIC SUCCESS CRITERIA**

**In addition to general template success criteria, ensure:**

- ✅ **Seamless Integration**: New Romanian scheduling features work perfectly with existing system
- ✅ **Brand Compliance**: All new components follow MedFlow brand guidelines and colors
- ✅ **Architecture Alignment**: Code follows established MedFlow patterns and structure
- ✅ **Visual Consistency**: New components use consistent styling and design patterns
- ✅ **Documentation Completeness**: All new features are properly documented
- ✅ **System Integrity**: No existing appointment functionality is broken or compromised

## 📚 **NEW PROJECT-SPECIFIC REQUIRED READING**

**In addition to general template required reading, review:**

4. **Existing appointment system code** - Understand current implementation patterns
5. **MedFlow localization standards** - Study existing language implementation
6. **Calendar and scheduling components** - Review existing UI patterns
7. **API integration patterns** - Understand existing endpoint structure

## 💡 **NEW PROJECT BEST PRACTICES**

- **Start Small**: Begin with Romanian language support, then add advanced features
- **Follow Patterns**: Use existing MedFlow appointment component structure
- **Test Incrementally**: Test each new feature before proceeding to the next
- **Maintain Consistency**: Use established styling and design patterns
- **Document Changes**: Update relevant documentation as you implement features
- **Consider Integration**: Think about how new features connect to existing appointment workflows
- **Preserve Performance**: Ensure new features don't degrade existing system performance
- **Plan for Scale**: Design features to handle growing user base and appointment volume
