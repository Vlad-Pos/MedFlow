**⚠️ CRITICAL: This is a NEW PROJECT within MedFlow. Follow these instructions with absolute precision.**

> **💡 For complete workflow guidance, read TEMPLATE_AUTOMATION.md after MAIN_GUIDE.md**

## 🎯 **TASK OVERVIEW**
**Goal**: Create new medical report generation component with Romanian language support
**Scope**: Report templates, data integration, PDF generation, Romanian medical terminology
**Timeline**: 4-6 days
**Priority**: Medium - Enhances doctor productivity and patient care
**Risk Level**: LOW - New component that doesn't affect existing functionality

## 🚨 **SAFETY REQUIREMENTS**
- **NEVER** expose patient data through insecure report generation
- **NEVER** modify existing medical data structures or patient records
- **ALWAYS** ensure GDPR compliance for report data handling
- **ALWAYS** maintain existing security and access control measures

## 📚 **CONTEXT & HISTORY**
- **Current Status**: Basic patient data exists but no automated report generation system
- **Previous Work**: Patient data management system implemented, basic medical records working
- **What NOT to Repeat**: Previous attempts at complex reporting that caused performance issues
- **Success Patterns**: Modular component design, efficient data processing, clear separation of concerns

## 🔧 **IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES**
✅ **What you CAN do**: 
- Create new report generation components and interfaces
- Implement Romanian medical terminology and language support
- Add PDF generation capabilities with MedFlow branding
- Create report templates for common medical scenarios
- Integrate with existing patient data system

❌ **What you CANNOT do**: 
- Modify existing patient data structures or medical records
- Change established security protocols or access controls
- Create reports that bypass existing data validation
- Implement features that could compromise patient privacy

## 📋 **EXECUTION STEPS**
1. **Requirements Analysis** - Define report types and Romanian medical terminology needs
2. **Component Architecture** - Design modular report generation system
3. **Implementation** - Build report templates and PDF generation engine
4. **Integration & Testing** - Connect with existing system and validate functionality

## 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA**
Your work will be successful if:
- ✅ Medical reports generate correctly with Romanian language support
- ✅ PDF output maintains MedFlow brand identity and professional appearance
- ✅ Report generation integrates seamlessly with existing patient data system
- ✅ All security and privacy requirements are maintained

## 📚 **REQUIRED READING**
Before starting, read:
1. **MedFlow/BRAND_IDENTITY.md** - Brand guidelines and the 12 new colors
2. **MedFlow/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md** - Technical standards and component architecture
3. **MedFlow/FEATURES_DOCUMENTATION.md** - Patient data system implementation

## 🎯 **NEW PROJECT-SPECIFIC SUCCESS CRITERIA**

**In addition to general template success criteria, ensure:**

- ✅ **Seamless Integration**: Report generation works perfectly with existing patient data
- ✅ **Brand Compliance**: All report templates follow MedFlow brand guidelines and colors
- ✅ **Architecture Alignment**: Code follows established MedFlow patterns and structure
- ✅ **Visual Consistency**: Generated reports use consistent styling and design patterns
- ✅ **Documentation Completeness**: All new components are properly documented
- ✅ **System Integrity**: No existing patient data functionality is broken or compromised

## 📚 **NEW PROJECT-SPECIFIC REQUIRED READING**

**In addition to general template required reading, review:**

4. **Existing patient data system code** - Understand current implementation patterns
5. **MedFlow component library** - Study existing component structure and patterns
6. **PDF generation standards** - Review existing document creation patterns
7. **Romanian medical terminology** - Understand language requirements

## 💡 **NEW PROJECT BEST PRACTICES**

- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic report templates, then add advanced features
- **Follow Patterns**: Use existing MedFlow component structure and naming conventions
- **Test Incrementally**: Test each report type before proceeding to the next
- **Maintain Performance**: Ensure report generation doesn't slow down existing system
- **Document Changes**: Update relevant documentation as you implement features
- **Consider Security**: Think about data access and privacy implications
- **Plan for Growth**: Design system to handle additional report types and languages
- **Validate Output**: Ensure generated reports meet medical documentation standards
