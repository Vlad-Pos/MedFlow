# üîß Section D: Maintenance

**Use this section when performing maintenance, bug fixes, or improvements within MedFlow.**

> **üí° This section extends the general template. Complete the general template first, then add these maintenance-specific guidelines.**

---

## üîß **MAINTENANCE SPECIFICS**

**Maintenance Type**: [Bug fix/Performance/Code cleanup/Documentation]
**Current Issues**: [What problems need solving]
**Improvement Goals**: [What should be better after]
**Existing Patterns**: [What established approaches to maintain]

**Additional Safety**: Never break existing functionality while improving
**Additional Context**: This maintains and improves existing systems

---

## üîß **ADDITIONAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES**

‚úÖ **What you CAN do**:
- Fix identified issues
- Improve performance where needed
- Clean up code following established patterns
- Update documentation for accuracy
- Enhance existing functionality incrementally
- Optimize existing code
- Refactor for better maintainability

‚ùå **What you CANNOT do**:
- Redesign working components
- Change established brand elements
- Add new enforcement mechanisms
- Break existing user workflows
- Ignore established patterns
- Introduce new bugs while fixing old ones
- Change working functionality unnecessarily

## üìã **MAINTENANCE-SPECIFIC EXECUTION STEPS**

**After completing general template execution steps, add these maintenance-specific actions:**

5. **Issue Analysis**: Deeply understand the specific problem or improvement needed
6. **Pattern Review**: Study how similar issues were solved in existing code
7. **Incremental Implementation**: Make small, testable improvements one at a time
8. **Regression Testing**: Verify each change works without breaking existing functionality
9. **Integration Validation**: Ensure changes work seamlessly with existing systems
10. **Documentation Update**: Update relevant documentation to reflect changes

---

## üéØ **MAINTENANCE-SPECIFIC SUCCESS CRITERIA**

**In addition to general template success criteria, ensure:**

- ‚úÖ **Issue Resolution**: Identified problems are completely resolved
- ‚úÖ **Performance Improvement**: Targeted performance gains are achieved
- ‚úÖ **Functionality Preservation**: All existing features continue to work correctly
- ‚úÖ **Code Quality**: Code maintainability and readability are improved
- ‚úÖ **Regression Prevention**: No new problems are introduced during fixes
- ‚úÖ **System Stability**: Overall system reliability is maintained or enhanced

---

## üìö **ADDITIONAL REQUIRED READING**

4. **Existing code** for established patterns
5. **Documentation** for current standards
6. **Issue reports** and user feedback
7. **Performance metrics** and benchmarks

---

## üí° **MAINTENANCE BEST PRACTICES**

- **Fix One Thing at a Time**: Don't try to solve multiple problems simultaneously
- **Test Each Change**: Verify each improvement works before moving to the next
- **Preserve Functionality**: Ensure existing features continue to work
- **Follow Established Patterns**: Use the same approaches that work elsewhere
- **Document Changes**: Record what was fixed and how
- **Measure Improvements**: Quantify the benefits of your changes
- **Consider Side Effects**: Think about how changes might affect other parts
- **Plan for Rollback**: Know how to undo changes if needed
