# üîÑ Section B: Continuations

**Use this section when continuing existing work or building on previous phases within MedFlow.**

> **üí° This section extends the general template. Complete the general template first, then add these continuation-specific guidelines.**

---

## üîÑ **CONTINUATION SPECIFICS**

**Previous Phase**: [What was completed]
**Current Approach**: [How the system currently works]
**Building On**: [Specific successful patterns to continue]
**Integration Points**: [How new work connects to existing]

**Additional Safety**: Never change the fundamental approach that's working
**Additional Context**: This builds on proven successful patterns

---

## üîß **ADDITIONAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES**

‚úÖ **What you CAN do**:
- Continue the established successful approach
- Enhance existing functionality incrementally
- Add new features following established patterns
- Improve documentation within current structure
- Build on proven successful patterns
- Extend existing functionality logically

‚ùå **What you CANNOT do**:
- Change the fundamental approach that's working
- Repeat previous problematic patterns
- Add any enforcement or blocking mechanisms
- Break existing functionality
- Ignore established successful patterns
- Redesign working systems

---

## üìã **CONTINUATION-SPECIFIC EXECUTION STEPS**

**After completing general template execution steps, add these continuation-specific actions:**

5. **Previous Work Analysis**: Thoroughly review what was accomplished and how it was implemented
6. **Success Pattern Identification**: Document what's working well and why it's successful
7. **Continuation Planning**: Design approach that builds on proven successful patterns
8. **Consistency Maintenance**: Ensure new work follows the same successful approach
9. **Integration Validation**: Verify new work integrates seamlessly with existing systems

---

## üéØ **CONTINUATION-SPECIFIC SUCCESS CRITERIA**

**In addition to general template success criteria, ensure:**

- ‚úÖ **Seamless Integration**: New work integrates perfectly with existing systems
- ‚úÖ **Pattern Consistency**: Established successful patterns are maintained and extended
- ‚úÖ **Approach Preservation**: The fundamental working approach remains unchanged
- ‚úÖ **Functionality Continuity**: All existing functionality continues to work perfectly
- ‚úÖ **Quality Standards**: Professional standards and gentle approach are maintained
- ‚úÖ **Success Extension**: New work builds on and enhances previous successes

---

## üìö **ADDITIONAL REQUIRED READING**

4. **Current project files** and recent changes
5. **Success patterns** from previous phases
6. **Established approach** that's working well

---

## üí° **CONTINUATION BEST PRACTICES**

- **Study Success**: Understand why previous approaches worked
- **Maintain Patterns**: Keep using the same successful methods
- **Incremental Growth**: Build on what's working, don't replace it
- **Consistent Quality**: Maintain the same high standards
- **Document Progress**: Record what's working and why
- **Avoid Regression**: Don't introduce problems that were solved before
