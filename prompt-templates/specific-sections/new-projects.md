# 🆕 Section A: New Projects

**Use this section when creating new features, components, or integrations within MedFlow.**

> **💡 This section extends the general template. Complete the general template first, then add these new project-specific guidelines.**

---

## 🚀 **NEW PROJECT SPECIFICS**

**Project Type**: [Feature/Component/Integration/Other]
**Dependencies**: [What other systems this affects]
**User Impact**: [How users will be affected]
**Testing Requirements**: [What needs to be tested]

**Additional Safety**: Never modify existing core functionality without permission
**Additional Context**: This is a completely new addition to MedFlow

---

## 🔧 **ADDITIONAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES**

✅ **What you CAN do**:
- Create new components following MedFlow patterns
- Implement new features within established architecture
- Add new documentation following current structure
- Enhance existing functionality incrementally
- Follow established naming conventions
- Use existing MedFlow design patterns

❌ **What you CANNOT do**:
- Redesign existing components without permission
- Change established brand elements
- Create blocking or enforcement mechanisms
- Break existing functionality
- Ignore established component architecture
- Use inconsistent styling or patterns

---

## 📋 **NEW PROJECT-SPECIFIC EXECUTION STEPS**

**After completing general template execution steps, add these new project-specific actions:**

5. **Pattern Analysis**: Study existing MedFlow component structure and naming conventions
6. **Brand Integration**: Ensure new elements follow MedFlow brand guidelines and colors
7. **Architecture Alignment**: Verify new features integrate with existing system architecture
8. **Component Testing**: Test new components with existing systems and workflows
9. **Documentation Integration**: Add new information to appropriate documentation files

---

## 🎯 **NEW PROJECT-SPECIFIC SUCCESS CRITERIA**

**In addition to general template success criteria, ensure:**

- ✅ **Seamless Integration**: New functionality works perfectly with existing systems
- ✅ **Brand Compliance**: All new elements follow MedFlow brand guidelines and colors
- ✅ **Architecture Alignment**: Code follows established MedFlow patterns and structure
- ✅ **Visual Consistency**: New components use consistent styling and design patterns
- ✅ **Documentation Completeness**: All new features are properly documented
- ✅ **System Integrity**: No existing functionality is broken or compromised

---

## 📚 **ADDITIONAL REQUIRED READING**

4. **MedFlow/FEATURES_DOCUMENTATION.md** - Feature implementation patterns
5. **Existing component files** - For established patterns and structure

---

## 💡 **NEW PROJECT BEST PRACTICES**

- **Start Small**: Begin with minimal viable implementation
- **Follow Patterns**: Use existing MedFlow component structure
- **Test Incrementally**: Test each small change before proceeding
- **Maintain Consistency**: Use established styling and patterns
- **Document Changes**: Update relevant documentation as you go
- **Consider Integration**: Think about how new features connect to existing systems
